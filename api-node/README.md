# Api-node

## Running locally

You need mongodb 4.2+ running, and node/pnpm installed.

```
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

## ðŸŒ± Seeding data

To get started easier, you can inject some data with:

```
pnpm seed
```

This will create three users, with emails `admin@test.com`, `user@test.com` and `user2@test.com`, and password `password`.

## ðŸ”§ Environment

Most of the configurable environment variables are shown in `app/config/env.ts`. You just need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the changed environement variables.

For example:

```bash
#.env file
NODE_ENV=production
automatedEmails=true
cron=1
sessionSecret=customSessionSecret
domain=my-domain.com
dbUrl=<custom mongodb url>
```
